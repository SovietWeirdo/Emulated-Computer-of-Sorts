So, this thing is the first "release" of the emulated computer i'm making. I have no idea when V1 will be released however.
Funny thing is, the only thing you can program is NOP (no operation) BRK (literally stops the emulated computer from running) and 
JMP (which starts executing code one byte AFTER the specified byte number.
I may work on a tool for automating the ROM generation.

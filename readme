Alright, this is a step towards Version 1.
I've added the MOV instruction which basically works like this: [ROMADDRESS1]: mov [ROMADDRESS2]: [RAM/VRAM address] [ROMADDRESS3]: [DATA]
The JMP instruction should go to the proper ROM address now.
In main.py i have commented out the function which makes the screen flash.
The ROM has come preloaded with a program that makes the first pixel on the display off.
